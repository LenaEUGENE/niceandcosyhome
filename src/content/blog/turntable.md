In today's fast-paced digital age, where streaming services dominate the music landscape, the classic turntable might seem like a relic of the past. However, there's a timeless charm and unique experience that comes with owning and using a turntable.  

The first and for some only reason to own a turntable is because it is time to go back to a time when people own their music (vinyl, cassette, cd..). Let's not forget that streaming services like Apple Music and Spotify are only "renting you" the music and top of paying artists very little.  

Now, Let's delve into the pros of having a turntable in your audio setup.  

**1. Audio Quality**  
One of the most compelling reasons to own a turntable is the unparalleled audio quality it offers. Vinyl records have a warmth and richness that digital formats often struggle to replicate. The analog nature of vinyl produces a unique sound profile characterized by subtle imperfections, which many audiophiles argue adds depth and character to the music. For music enthusiasts who prioritize sound quality, a turntable is an essential component of their setup.  


**2. Tactile Experience**  
Unlike digital music players, using a turntable offers a tactile and interactive experience. There's something inherently satisfying about carefully selecting a record, gently placing it on the platter, and delicately lowering the tonearm. The act of physically engaging with the music adds a level of intimacy and connection that clicking a button on a screen simply can't replicate. It's a ritualistic experience that allows listeners to engage with their music on a deeper level.  


**3. Artistic Presentation**  
Vinyl records are not just about the music; they're also about the artwork and craftsmanship that goes into creating them. Album covers, liner notes, and sleeve designs are often considered works of art in their own right, adding an extra dimension to the listening experience. Displaying vinyl records in a collection allows music lovers to appreciate the artistic expression that accompanies their favorite albums. Owning a turntable is not just about listening to music; it's about celebrating the entire creative process behind it.  

**4. Longevity and Durability**  
Vinyl records have stood the test of time, remaining a durable and long-lasting format for music storage. Unlike digital files that can be corrupted or lost due to technological obsolescence, vinyl records can last for decades when properly cared for. With a turntable, listeners can enjoy music from their favorite artists for years to come, passing down their collections as cherished heirlooms to future generations.  

**5. Community and Connection**  
Owning a turntable can also foster a sense of community and connection among music enthusiasts. Vinyl record stores, flea markets, and record fairs serve as gathering places where like-minded individuals can share their passion for music and vinyl culture. Whether it's discussing favorite albums, trading records, or attending live music events, owning a turntable opens doors to a vibrant and welcoming community of music lovers.  

**Which one to chose?**  
There is plenty of choices, but let's say my heart sink a little when I understood that, now that turntable are once more fashionable I could have to spend 500€ and above to snatch one.
